iOS Application that can help small business owners managing their inventory and products.
Hassad was build using [BusinessManagerAPI](https://github.com/gyda13/BusinessManagerAPI).

This application is designed to make the lives of small business owners easier by taking the guesswork out of 
pricing and inventory management, also it provides detailed analytics on your sales, so that you can see which
products are selling well and which ones are not performing as well as expected. This helps you make informed
decisions about how to price and manage your inventory in order to maximize profits.
